- Hi, I’m @Dragontryy
- I am in crypto from 2020. I am professional noderunners investors, developers with several years of experience and working with different projects.
- I run nodes (validator or full nodes) for different perspective projects: umee, subspace, mina, aleo, archway etc. 
- Currently I am running; Sui, Espresso, Bundlr, Forta, Stride, Sei, Rebus and more. 
- I use different cloud servers from Hetzner, Vultr for testnets or mainnet but 
I’m ready to grow big if needed and jump to other serious hosting for a dedicated server.

- I'm ready to support! if you want to contact with me please kindly click my twitter link on my github profile
- Best Regards.✨
